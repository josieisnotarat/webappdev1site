# Web App Development I Project Backups

This repository contains a backup of my testing site for *Web App Development I*. The application is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **PHP**, and was originally designed to interact with a **MySQL** database hosted on a school-run server.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – For semantic structure and accessible markup
- **CSS3** – For layout and styling, with light use of variables and modern selectors
- **PHP** – For server-side scripting, form handling, database queries, and dynamic content rendering
- **MySQL (not included)** – Used during development for persistent data storage

## ⚠️ Notice

> **Database functionality may be limited or non-functional in this backup.**  
> This project originally relied on a MySQL database managed by my school’s IT infrastructure. Remaining code referring to this database may be nonworking or incomplete. As a matter of fact, a majority of it has been purposefully removed to maintain security.
>
> If you'd like to restore full functionality, you’ll need to:
>
> - Set up a local or remote MySQL server
> - Create the required database and tables (schema not included unless otherwise documented)
> - Update any database connection credentials in the PHP files (`localhost`, `username`, `password`, `database_name`)
>
> **Additionally, not all assignments are promised to work 100%. This backup is primarily meant to serve as reference for me, and evidence of my progress as a developer. **
