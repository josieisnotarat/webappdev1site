# Web App Development I - Final Project Backup

This repository contains a backup of my final project for *Web App Development I*. The application is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **PHP**, and was originally designed to interact with a **MySQL** database hosted on a school-run server.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – For semantic structure and accessible markup
- **CSS3** – For layout and styling, with light use of variables and modern selectors
- **PHP** – For server-side scripting, form handling, database queries, and dynamic content rendering
- **MySQL (not included)** – Used during development for persistent data storage

## ⚠️ Notice

> **Database functionality may be limited or non-functional in this backup.**  
> This project originally relied on a MySQL database managed by my school’s IT infrastructure. If you'd like to restore full functionality, you’ll need to:
>
> - Set up a local or remote MySQL server
> - Create the required database and tables (schema not included unless otherwise documented)
> - Update any database connection credentials in the PHP files (`localhost`, `username`, `password`, `database_name`)


## 🔐 Security Note

This project was developed as a class assignment and may not follow production-level security best practices. Do not deploy it publicly without proper sanitization, validation, and security hardening.

## 📚 Credits

Developed by **Josie** as part of the *Web App Development I* course.
